Recommended EditorConfig for Vited projects

```ini
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
indent_size = 2
indent_style = space
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
quote_type = single
max_line_length = 120
```

If you created your project with vited, this editorconfig should already be included. If not, copy above content into your `.editorconfig` file.
